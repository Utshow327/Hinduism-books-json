Tell me so briefly, poor one.\n\nYou know the pain of saints and saints. Describe their natural nature.\n\nWhich virtue is known by the Shruti. Tell me which sin is most ferocious.\n\nYou explained the mental illness to me. You have shown utmost kindness to everyone.\n\nFather, listen with great respect and love. I will briefly tell you this policy.\n\nThere is no one like the human body. The animate and inanimate beings know everything. That only.\n\nHell, heaven and heaven will reside in it. Knowledge, renunciation and devotion give good fortune.\n\nThose who do not worship Hari after taking such a body, become addicted to worldly things, they will slowly get salvation.\n\nBy changing the glass into pieces, they will take it.

The saint is unfortunate for the sake of others' suffering.\n\nThe saint is merciful like the Birch tree. He bears the calamity with the policy of helping others.\n\nHe bound the wicked man. By embroidering his skin, he died bearing the calamity.\n\nThe wicked man is harmful without any selfishness. Listen o mouse. Uragari.\n\nThe wealth of others cannot be destroyed, just like snow and ice are burnt by the moon.\n\nThe wicked rise for the world's worship, just like the famous evil planet Ketu.\n\nThe rise of the saints makes the saints happy, just like the moon and the moon are pleasant to the world.\n\nThe supreme religion is non-violence, known by the Shrutis.

Anger and bile burn the chest daily.\n\nIf all three brothers love each other, a painful outcome arises.\n\nThe sensual desires are many and inaccessible. I know the names of all those pains.\n\nAffection is jealous of the grandfather, and there is abundance of joy and sadness.\n\nBut seeing happiness, it is burnt.
