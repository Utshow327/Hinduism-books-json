    "verse": "Peaceful lived the righteous people, rich in wealth in merit high , Envy dwelt not i n their bosoms and their accents shaped no lie, Fathers with their happy households owned their cattle, corn and gold , Galling penury and famine in Ayodhya had no hold , Neighbours lived in mutual kindness helpful with their ample wealth, None who beg ged the wasted refuse, none who lived by fraud and stealth ! And they wore the gem and earring, wreath and fragrant sandal paste, And their arms were decked with bracelets, and their necks with niksh as graced, Cheat and braggart and deceiver lived not in the ancient town, Proud despiser of the lowly wore not insults in their frown , Poorer fed not on the richer, hireling friend upon the great, None with low and lying accents did upon the proud man wait ! Men to plighted vows were faithful, faith ful was each loving wife , Impure thought and wandering fancy stained not holy wedded life, Robed in gold and graceful garments, fair in form and fair in face , Winsome were Ayodhya ’ s daughters, rich in wit and woman ’ s grace! T wice - born men were free f rom passion, lust of gold and impure greed, Faithful to their Rites and Scriptures, truthful in their word and deed , Altar blazed in every mansion, from each home was bounty given, Stooped no man to fulsome falsehood, questioned none the will of Heave n . Kshatras bowed to holy Brahman s, Vaisyas to the Kshatras bowed, Toiling Sudras lived by labour, of their honest duty proud, To the Gods and to the Fathers, to each guest in virtue trained, Rites were done with due devotion as by holy writ ordained . Pure each caste in due observance, stainless was each ancient rite, And the nation thrived and prospered by its old and matchless might , And each man in truth abiding lived a long and peaceful life, With his sons and with his grandsons, with his lov ed and honoured wife . Thus was ruled the ancient city by her monarch true and bold , As the earth was ruled by Manu in the misty days of old ,"

For the faithful woman follows where her wedded lord may lead, In the banishment of Rama, Sita’s exile is decreed, Sire nor son nor loving brother rules the wedded woman’s state, With her lord she falls or rises, with her consort courts her fate, If the righteous son of Raghu wends to forests dark and drear, Sita steps before her husband wild and thorny paths to clear! Like the tasted refuse water cast thy timid thoughts aside, Take me to the pathless jungle, bid me by my lord abide, Car and steed and gilded palace, vain are these to woman’s life, Dearer is her husband’s shadow to the loved and loving wife! For my mother often taught me and my father often spake, That her home the wedded woman doth beside her husband make, As the shadow to the substance, to her lord is faithful wife, And she parts not from her consort till she parts with fleeting life! Therefore bid me seek the jungle and in pathless forests roam, Where the wild deer freely ranges and the tiger makes his home, Happier than in father’s mansions in the woods will Sita rove, Waste no thought on home or kindred, nestling in her husband’s love! World-renowned is Rama’s valour, fearless by her Rama’s side, Sita still will live and wander with a faithful woman’s pride, And the wild fruit she will gather from the fresh and fragrant wood, And the food by Rama tasted shall be Sita’s cherished food! Bid me seek the sylvan greenwoods, wooded hills and plateaus high, Limpid rills and crystal nullas as they softly ripple by, And where in the lake of lotus tuneful ducks their plumage lave, Let me with my loving Rama skim the cool translucent wave! Years will pass in happy union, – happiest lot to woman given, – Sita seeks not throne or empire, nor the brighter joys of heaven, Heaven conceals not brighter mansions in its sunny fields of pride, Where without her lord and husband faithful Sita would reside! Therefore let me seek the jungle where the jungle-rangers rove, Dearer than the royal palace, where I share my husband’s love, And my heart in sweet communion shall my Rama’s wishes share, And my wifely toil shall lighten Rama’s load of woe and care!"

    "verse": "Heedless child is he, Kausalya, in his fate who doth not scan Retribution of his karma, sequence of a mighty plan ! Oft in madness and in folly we destroy the mango grove , Plant the gorgeous gay palasa for the red flower that we love, Fruitless as the red palasa is the karma I have sown, And my barren lifetime withers through the deed which is my own ! Listen to my tale, Kausalya , in my days of youth renowned, I was called a sabda - bedhi , archer prince who shot by sound, I could hit the unseen target, by the sound my aim could tell, – Blindly drinks a child the poison, blindly in my pride I fell ! I was then my father ’ s Regent, thou a maid to me unknown , Hunting by the fair Sarayu in my car I drove alone, Buffalo or jungle tusker might frequent the river ’ s brink , Nimble deer or watchful tiger stealing for his nightly drink, Stalking with a hunter ’ s patience, loitering in the forests drear, Sound of something in the water struck my keen and listening ear, In the dark I stood and listened, some wild beast the water drunk, ’ Tis some elephant, I pondered, lifting water with its trunk . I was called a sabda - bedhi , archer prince who shot by sound , On the unseen fancied tusker dealt a sure and deadly wound , Ah ! too deadly was my arrow and like hissing cobra fell, On my startled ear and bosom smote a voice of human wail, Dying voice of lamentation rose upon the midnight high, Till my weapons fell in tremor and a darkness dimmed my eye ! Hastening with a nameless terror soon I reached Sarayu ’ s shore , Saw a boy with hermit ’ s tresses, and his pitcher lay before, Weltering in a pool of red blood, lying on a gory bed, Feebly raised his voice the hermit, and in dying accents said : ‘ What offence, O mighty monarch, all - unknowing have I done, That with quick and kingly justice slayest thus a hermit ’ s son ? Old and feeble are my parents, sightless by the will of fate, Thirsty in their humble cottage for their duteous boy they wait, And thy shaft that kills me, monarch, bids my ancient parents die , Helpless, friendless, they will perish, in their anguish deep and high ! Sacred lore and life - long penance change not mortal ’ s earthly state, Wherefore else they sit unconscious when their son is doomed by fate , Or if conscious of my danger, could they dying breath recall, Can the tall tree save the sapling doomed by woodman ’ s axe to fall ? Hasten to my parents, monarch, soothe their sorrow and their ire, For the tears of good and righteous wither like the forest fire, Short the pathway to the asram , soon the cottage thou shalt see , Soothe their anger by entreaty, ask their grace and pardon free ! But before thou goest, monarch, take, O take thy torturing dart, For it rankles in my bosom with a cruel burning smart, And it eats into my young life as the river ’ s rolling tide By the rains of summer swollen eats into its yielding side .’ Writhing in his pain and anguish thus the wounded hermit cried, And I drew the fatal arrow, and the holy hermit died ! Darkly fell the thickening shadows, stars their feeble radiance lent, As I filled the hermit ’ s pitcher, to his sightless parents went, Darkly fell the moonless midnight, deeper gloom my bosom rent, As with faint and falt ’ ring footsteps to the hermits slow I went . Like two birds bereft of plumage, void of strength, deprived of flight, Were the stricken ancient hermits, friendless, helpless, void of sight, Lisping in their feeble accents still they whispered of their child, Of the stainless boy whose red blood Dasa - ratha ’ s hands defiled ! And the father heard my footsteps, spake in accents soft and kind : ‘Come, my son, to waiting parents, wherefore dost thou stay behind, Sporting in the rippling water didst thou midnight ’ s hour beguile, But thy faint and thirsting mother anxious waits for thee the while,"

From his pierced and quivering bosom then the cruel dart I drew , And he sorrowed for his parents as his spirit heavenward flew, Thus unconscious, holy father, I have slayed thy stainless son, Speak my penance, or in mercy pardon deed unknowing done ! ’"

With the winter’s ample harvest men perform each pious rite, To the Fathers long departed, to the Gods of holy might, With the rite of agrayana pious men their sins dispel, And with gay and sweet observance songs of love the women tell, And the monarchs bent on conquest mark the winter’s cloudless glow, Lead their bannered cars and forces ’gainst the rival and the foe! Southwards rolls the solar chariot, and the cold and widowed North Reft of ‘bridal mark’ and joyance coldly sighs her sorrows forth, Southward rolls the solar chariot, Himalaya, ‘home of snow,’ True to name and appellation doth in whiter garments glow, Southward rolls the solar chariot, cold and crisp the frosty air, And the wood of flower dismantled doth in russet robes appear! Star of Pushya rules December and the night with rime is hoar, And beneath the starry welkin in the woods we sleep no more, And the pale moon mist-enrouded sheds a faint and feeble beam, As the breath obscures the mirror, winter mist obscures her gleam,"

Sweeping blasts from western mountains through the gorges whistle by, And the saras and the curlew raise their shrill and piercing cry, Boundless fields of wheat and barley are with dewdrops moist and wet, And the golden rice of winter ripens like the clustering date, Peopled marts and rural hamlets wake to life and cheerful toil, And the peaceful happy nations prosper on their fertile soil! Mark the sun in morning vapours – like the moon subdued and pale – Brightening as the day advances piercing through the darksome veil, Mark his gay and golden lustre sparkling o’er the dewy lea, Mantling hill and field and forest, painting bush and leaf and tree, Mark it glisten on the green grass, on each bright and bending blade, Lighten up the long drawn vista, shooting through the gloomy glade! Thirst-impelled the lordly tusker still avoids the freezing drink, Wild duck and the tuneful hansa doubtful watch the river’s brink, From the rivers wrapped in vapour unseen cries the wild curlew, Unseen rolls the misty streamlet o’er its sandbank soaked in dew, And the drooping water-lily bends her head beneath the frost, Lost her fresh and fragrant beauty and her tender petals lost! Now my errant fancy wanders to Ayodhya’s distant town, Where in hermit’s barks and tresses Bharat wears the royal crown, Scorning regal state and splendour, spurning pleasures loved of yore, Spends his winter day in penance, sleeps at night upon the floor, Aye! perchance Sarayu’s waters seeks he now, serene and brave, As we seek, when dawns the daylight, Godavari’s limpid wave! Rich of hue, with eye of lotus, truthful, faithful, strong of mind, For the love he bears thee, Rama, spurns each joy of baser kind, ‘False he proves unto his father who is led by mother’s wile’ – Vain this ancient impious adage – Bharat spurns his mother’s guile,"

And my loving mem’ry lingers on each word from Bharat fell, Sweeter than the draught of nectar, purer than the crystal well, And my righteous purpose falters, shaken by a brother’s love, May we meet again our brother, if it please the Gods above!” Waked by love, a silent tear-drop fell on Godavari’s wave, True once more to righteous purpose Rama’s heart was calm and brave, Rama plunged into the river ’neath the morning’s crimson beam, Sita softly sought the waters as the lily seeks the stream, And they prayed to Gods and Fathers with each rite and duty done, And they sang the ancient mantra to the red and rising Sun, With her lord, in loosened tresses Sita to her cottage came, As with RUDRA wanders UMA in Kailasa’s hill of fame!"

Help me, ever righteous Rama, duty bade thee yield thy throne, Duty bids thee smite the sinful, save the wife who is thy own, Thou art king and stern chastiser of each deed of sin and shame, Hurl thy vengeance on the Raksha who insults thy faithful dame! Deed of sin, unrighteous Ravan, brings in time its dreadful meed, As the young corn grows and ripens from the small and living seed, For this deed of insult, Ravan, in thy heedless folly done, Death of all thy race and kindred thou shalt reap from Raghu’s son! Darksome woods of Panchavati, Janasthana’s smiling vale, Flowering trees and winding creepers, murmur to my lord this tale, Sweet companions of my exile, friends who cheered my woodland stay, Speak to Rama, that his Sita ruthless Ravan bears away! Towering peaks and lofty mountains, wooded hills sublime and high, Far-extending gloomy ranges heaving to the azure sky, In your voice of pealing thunder to my lord and consort say, Speak to Rama, that his Sita ruthless Ravan bears away! Unseen dwellers of the woodlands, spirits of the rock and fell, Sita renders you obeisance as she speaks her sad farewell, Whisper to my righteous Rama when he seeks his homeward way, Speak to Rama, that his Sita ruthless Ravan bears away! Ah, my Rama, true and tender! thou hast loved me as thy life, From the foul and impious Raksha thou shalt still redeem thy wife, Ah, my Rama, mighty-arméd! vengeance soon shall speed thy way, When thou hearest, helpless Sita is by Ravan torn away! And thou royal bird, Jatayu, witness Ravan’s deed of shame, Witness how he courts destruction, stealing Rama’s faithful dame, Rama and the gallant Lakshman soon shall find their destined prey, When they know that trusting Sita is by Ravan torn away!” Vainly wept the anguished Sita; vain Jatayu in his wrath, Fought with beak and bloody talons to impede the Raksha’s path, Pierced and bleeding fell the vulture; Ravan fled with Rama’s bride, Where amidst the boundless ocean Lanka rose in towering pride!"

There Sugriva king of Vanars, Hanuman his henchman brave, Banished from their home and empire lived within the forest cave, To the exiled king Sugriva, Hanuman his purpose told, As he marked the pensive Rama wand’ring with his brother bold: “Mark the sons of Dasa-ratha banished from their royal home, Duteous to their father’s mandate in these pathless forests roam, Great was monarch Dasa-ratha famed for sacrifice divine, Raja-suya, Aswa-medha, and for gift of gold and kine, By a monarch’s stainless duty people’s love the monarch won, By a woman’s false contrivance banished he his eldest son! True to duty, true to virtue, Rama passed his forest life, Till a false perfidious Raksha stole his fair and faithful wife,"

Equal is our fateful fortune, – I have lost a queenly wife, Banished from Kishkindha’s empire here I lead a forest life, Pledge of love and true alliance, Rama, take this proffered hand, Banded by a common sorrow we shall fall or stoutly stand!” Rama grasped the hand he offered, and the tear was in his eye, And they swore undying friendship o’er the altar blazing high, Hanuman with fragrant blossoms sanctified the sacred rite, And the comrades linked by sorrow walked around the altar’s light, And their word and troth they plighted: “In our happiness and woe, We are friends in thought and action, we will face our common foe!” And they broke a leafy Sal tree, spread it underneath their feet, Rama and his friend Sugriva sat upon the common seat, And a branch of scented Chandan with its tender blossoms graced, Hanuman as seat of honour for the faithful Lakshman placed. “Listen, Rama,” spake Sugriva, “reft of kingdom, reft of wife, Fleeing to these rugged mountains I endure a forest life, For my tyrant brother Bali rules Kishkindha all alone, Forced my wife from my embraces, drove me from my father’s throne, Trembling in my fear and anguish I endure a life of woe, Render me my wife and empire from my brother and my foe!” “Not in vain they seek my succour,” so the gallant Rama said, “Who with love and offered friendship seek my counsel and my aid,"

Bali knew that proud defiance shaking sky and solid ground, And like sun by eclipse shaded, dark and pale he looked around, And his teeth were set in anger and a passion lit his eye, As a tempest stirs a torrent when its lilies scattered lie, And he rose in wrath terrific with a thought of vengeance dread, And the firm earth shook and trembled ’neath his proud and haughty tread! But the true and tender Tara held her husband and her lord, And a woman’s deeper wisdom spake in woman’s loving word: “Wherefore like a rain-fed torrent swells thy passion in its sway, Thoughts of wrath like withered blossoms from thy bosom cast away, Wait till dawns another morning, wait till thou dost truly know, With what strength and added forces comes again thy humbled foe. Crushed in combat faint Sugriva fled in terror and in pain, Trust me, not without a helper comes he to the fight again, Trust me, lord, that loud defiance is no coward’s falt’ring cry, Conscious strength not hesitation speaks in voice so proud and high!

Therefore bid me seek the jungle and in pathless forests roam, Where the wild deer freely ranges and the tiger makes his home, Happier than in father’s mansions in the woods will Sita rove, Waste no thought on home or kindred, nestling in her husband’s love!"
